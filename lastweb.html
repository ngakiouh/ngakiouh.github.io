<p>"The three little pigs were very excited. They had been planning this day for a long time. They knew that the wolf was a killer, but they also knew that they were faster and smarter than the wolf. They had practiced running and hiding and were confident that they could outwit the wolf. The first little pig ran as fast as he could and was the first to make it to the safety of the straw house. The second little pig was not far behind and made it to the safety of the sticks house.
The third little pig was the slowest and was not sure if he would make it to the safety of the bricks house. The wolf saw the first two pigs running and was very angry AND KILLED THE LAST PIG."</p>

My analysis:the paragraph was short but it had creativity towards the death of the three littles pigs, the paragraph used toil, through the third little pig it emphasizes the fourtune of th first two pigs and the evilness of the wolf.&nbsp; The contrast between the different destinies of the three pigs has a deep moral lesson: sometimes destiny and fate is more important than the effort taken. But still, the words and expressions were somehow bland, and the repetition of phrases&nbsp; when describing the situation and self-struggling is not as impressive as expected.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
